# BlockchainLandRegistry
A modern solution for land registration, verification, and ownership transfer, powered by blockchain technology with government approval.

## Features

- **Immutable Records**: Once verified, land ownership records cannot be altered, providing unquestionable proof of ownership
- **Government Verification**: All land registrations and transfers are verified by authorized government officials
- **Secure Transactions**: Smart contracts with escrow functionality protect buying and selling
- **Complete Transparency**: Track registration and transfer status with blockchain verification

## User Roles

- **Land Owner**: Register land and list properties for sale
- **Buyer**: Browse and purchase verified properties
- **Verifier**: Government officials who verify land registrations and transfers
- **Admin**: System administrators managing users and monitoring operations
- **General Visitor**: Browse public property listings

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts for land ownership NFTs
- **Storage**: IPFS for property documents

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- Other required environment variables (see `.env.example`)
