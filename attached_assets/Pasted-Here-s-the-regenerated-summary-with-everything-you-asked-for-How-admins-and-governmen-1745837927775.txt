Hereâ€™s the **regenerated summary** with everything you asked for:  
- How **admins** and **government officials (registrars)** register and log in,  
- How **routing** should work so each user sees only their correct dashboard.

**Land Registry System Overview**  
Users must first create an account using traditional email and password login. After login, they connect their blockchain wallet to perform blockchain-related actions like land registration or transfer.

**User Types and Registration:**  
- Land Owner: Self-registers through public signup form.  
- Buyer: Self-registers through public signup form.  
- Government Official (Registrar/Verifier): Must be manually created by Admin or verified through a special secure onboarding portal. Cannot self-register directly.  
- Admin: First Admin account is created manually during system setup. Future Admins can be added by an existing Admin.

**User Login and Access Control:**  
- All users login with email and password.  
- Wallet connection happens after login for blockchain operations.
- Role-based routing after login ensures that each user sees only their allowed dashboard.

**Routing Logic:**  
- Land Owner â†’ Routed to "Land Owner Dashboard"  
  (Register land, view owned lands, list for sale, track verification status, manage profile)  
- Buyer â†’ Routed to "Buyer Dashboard"  
  (Browse verified lands, buy lands, view purchase history, manage profile)  
- Government Official (Registrar) â†’ Routed to "Verifier Dashboard"  
  (View pending land registrations and transfer requests, approve/reject them)  
- Admin â†’ Routed to "Admin Dashboard"  
  (Manage users and roles, monitor system activity, view analytics, resolve disputes)  
- General Visitor (not logged in) â†’ Routed to "Landing Page" and "Public Listings Page"  
  (Can browse verified land listings, but no registration or buying until sign-up)

**Flow Summary:**  
1. User signs up (email + password).  
2. After login, system detects user role and routes them to their specific dashboard.  
3. User connects wallet to enable blockchain actions like land registration or transfer.  
4. Land Owner submits land for registration.  
5. Government Official reviews and approves/rejects registrations and ownership transfers.  
6. Upon approval, NFTs are minted or transferred.  
7. Buyers purchase land; payment is held in escrow until government approval finalizes transfer.

**Key Features:**  
- Traditional authentication + optional wallet connection after login.  
- Land registration and ownership transfer require government approval before completion.  
- Role-based routing to different dashboards depending on user type.  
- Escrow smart contracts protect buyer payments during ownership transfers.  
- Blockchain records all verification decisions for full transparency.  
- Clear status indicators for land (Pending Approval, Verified, Rejected).

**Quick Role-to-Routing Map:**

- `/dashboard/buyer` â†’ Buyers  
- `/dashboard/verifier` â†’ Government Officials (Registrars)  
- `/dashboard/admin` â†’ Admins  
- `/landing` â†’ General Visitors

Would you also like me to suggest how you could structure this routing easily in your MERN app (React + Express routes)?  
It would be simple to plug in based on this structure. ðŸš€
