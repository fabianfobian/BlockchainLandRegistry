How Users Should Interact with the System (Step-by-Step)
1. Land Owner Interaction Flow

    Register and log in using traditional sign-up (email, password, possibly KYC info).

    After login, connect blockchain wallet to the account.

    Submit a new land registration:

        Fill land information (title, description, map coordinates, etc.).

        Upload required documents (title deed, ID, etc.), stored on IPFS.

        The land is submitted as a pending registration request.

    Wait for government approval:

        Government verifier checks submission and approves/rejects.

        If approved, a smart contract mints a land NFT and assigns it to the owner's connected wallet address.

    List the land for sale (optional):

        Set a price and make it visible to potential buyers.

    Initiate transfer request when a buyer is found:

        Submit sale transaction, which also requires government approval before transfer finalization.

2. Buyer Interaction Flow

    Register and log in using traditional sign-up.

    Connect wallet after login to enable purchase functionalities.

    Browse only verified lands available for sale.

    Make an offer and pay into a secure escrow smart contract.

    Await government verification of the transfer.

    Upon approval, land NFT is transferred to buyer’s wallet address.

    View land ownership in the personal dashboard.

3. Verifier (Government Official) Interaction Flow

    Log in using official credentials.

    Connect government-issued blockchain wallet for signing approvals.

    View all pending land registration requests and ownership transfer requests.

    Review the land details and documents.

    Approve or reject requests:

        Approval leads to minting NFT or transferring NFT ownership.

        Rejection includes providing a reason recorded on-chain and off-chain.

    All actions are permanently logged to ensure public auditability.

4. Admin Interaction Flow

    Log in with administrator credentials.

    Assign verifier roles to government officials.

    Monitor all pending and approved transactions across the platform.

    Manage users, including suspending fraudulent accounts if needed.

    Access analytics like number of registered lands, number of ownership changes, average time to approval.

5. General Visitor Interaction Flow

    No login required for browsing.

    Search for verified lands using public search tools.

    View detailed listings but cannot initiate buying or selling without creating an account.
